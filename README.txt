D-Hastie Euler Problems Git Repo

A repository of Euler Problem attempts.
Project Euler (projecteuler.net) is a collection of challenging mathematical problems that are best solved with computer programming methods. Solutions require a combination of mathematical, programming, logic and creativity to solve.

I suggest only using my code as a guide if you are stuck. There many ways to solve the problems, some methods being more elegant than others.
